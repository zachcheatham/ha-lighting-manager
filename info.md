# Home Assistant Lighting Manager

Instead of maintaining one previous light state using scene.create, this integration allows lights to maintain layers that can be added to or removed from in any order. Very useful for lights that can indicate multiple alerts or other entity's state.

## Installation

1) Install this repository via HACS

2) In Home Assistant 2025.7 or later, add *Lighting Manager* from the integrations UI and select the lights you want to manage. Options such as adaptive elevation limits can be changed from the integration options after setup.
